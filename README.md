## Step by Step Full DevOps Project, we will create a Kubernetes Cluster with High Availability, Auto-Healing, Reliability, Auto Scaling, Monitoring, and Securing on the Amazon EKS via Terraform or Cloudformation. To do these, we will create and use GitOps Workflow(ArgoCD), Jenkins, Rancher, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), RDS MySQL Database, VPC (with both public and private subnets) for Amazon EKS, AWS Secrets Manager, Amazon Route53, Amazon Cloudfront, AWS Certificate Manager, Let's Encrypt-Cert Manager, CloudWatch, Prometheus and Grafana. We will do these practically step by step.
